##Problem Statement:

The project aims to segment Lending Club's customers base so that P2P investors are better able to understand their expected returns given their lenders characetrisitics. For that purpose we will use two variables: PD (Probability of Default) and LGD (Loss Given Default). We will then have a model that allows us to estimate expected returns for each investment.


##Process:

### 1) Define Business Problem
Lending Club allows people with weak financial knowledge to invest in what can be highly risky assets. Our goal is to provide potential investors with inteligence that allows them to make better investment decisions. For that purpose we analize 500k entries of past data past investment data to build a predictive model. Our key risk parameter will be the Probability of Default (PD), i.e. the probability of a lender not servicing his debt on time

### 2) Collect and Clean Up Data

Before beginning the analysis of the data, ensure that the raw data is complete and organized in a way that is conducive to the analysis.  The actions to be taken are as follows:

- Download data as a .csv file from lendingclub.com or kaggle.com
- Load the data and make a working copy (so that none of the raw data was lost in case we wanted to recover it later)


```{r setupdata1E, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
# Please ENTER the name of the file with the data used. The file should be a .csv with one row per observation (e.g. person) and one column per attribute. Do not add .csv at the end, make sure the data are numeric.
datafile_name = "../bdagroupproject/Data/loancopy_1.csv"

# Please enter the minimum number below which you would like not to print - this makes the readability of the tables easier. Default values are either 10e6 (to print everything) or 0.5. Try both to see the difference.
MIN_VALUE = 0.5

# Please enter the maximum number of observations to show in the report and slides. 
# DEFAULT is 10. If the number is large the report may be slow.
max_data_report = 10
```

```{r}
ProjectData <- read.csv(datafile_name)
ProjectData <- data.matrix(ProjectData) 
ProjectData_INITIAL <- ProjectData
```

- Test unique identifier for each entry/loan by seeing if there are any double entries under the “id” and “member_id” columns
- Eliminate variables that are out of scope or are too lengthy to parse/process for the benefit of analysis:
    + Remove active loans (i.e. loans that haven’t had the opportunity to default or not because they are still ongoing) and loans with a blank status
    + Remove columns deemed unnecessary to analyze as they wouldn’t provide useful information (e.g. “url”: URL for the Lending Club page with listing data)
    +	Remove columns that are too difficult to standardize (e.g. “desc”: loan description provided by the borrower; or “emp_title”: employee title)
    +	Remove columns that represent similar information to other columns (e.g. “desc” is largely covered by the more standardized “purpose” field)
    +	Remove columns containing information that would only be obtained AFTER somebody became a client (i.e. couldn’t be used to make the initial lending decision) (e.g. “tot_coll_amt”: total collection amounts ever owed; or “last_pymnt_d”: last month payment was received)
- Exclude entries with missing information
    + Remove columns where there is mostly missing information, even if that column would have otherwise been informative
    + Remove rows where there is any missing information
- Combine non-numeric descriptions when appropriate, for example:
    + The Charge-Off and Default classifications could be combined into one Default category under the “loan_status” field because default occurs before charge-off (after 121 days vs. 150 days)
    + The “purpose” column had a number of non-numeric values such as “debt consolidation” or “home improvement”; however, over 80% of entries were debt-related, so it seemed reasonable to split the data into just two categories: debt-related and other
- Correct errors
    + The “issue_d” column had the dates formatted backwards, so, for example, January 2014 was showing as January 14, 2017; reformat to make the correction (note that due to lack of better information, assumptions can be made such as all issue dates occur on the first of the month)


### 3) Ensure Data Is Metric

In order to begin analysing the data (generating descriptive statistics, etc.), data must be metric (i.e. numbers, and specifically numbers that have meaningful hierarchical values).

- Remove text from otherwise numeric fields.  For example:
    + The “term” column had values of “36 months” or “60 months”; change to simply “36” or “60”, respectively
    + The “emp_length” column had values of “[x] years”; change to simply “[x]”
    + The “emp_length” column also had values of “<1”, “n/a” and “10+”; change to “0”, “0” and “10”, respectively
- Create dummy variables for non-numeric values.  For example:
    + Add a separate column “emp_length_known” to separate which customers have “n/a” values for “emp_length” (indicated by a 0 here)
    + The “home_ownership” column had values of “Own”, “Mortgage” or “Rent”; separate into three columns: “home_renter”, “home_mortgager” and “home_owner”; a “1” in these columns indicates membership in that category
    + The “loan_status” column had values of “Fully Paid” or “Default”; change to “1” to indicate fully paid and “0” to indicate default
- Convert non-numeric but hierarchical data into numbers, for example:
    + The “grade” column had ratings of A to G; change to ratings of 1 to 7
    + The “sub_grade” column had ratings of A1 – G5; change to 1.0 to 7.8 (each increment adds 0.2, so that, for example, B2 becomes 2.2 or D4 becomes 4.6)
- Convert physical addresses into a format in which distances can be measured
    + Two columns, “zip_code” and “addr_state”, provided information about customer addresses; however, “zip_code” was in the form “###xx”, showing only the first three numbers of a zipcode; therefore, it was not metric and this field was excluded
    + In order to make “addr_state” metric, the mid-point latitude and longitude of each state was added as two new columns: “addr_lat” and “addr_lon”, respectively; the original "addr_state" field was then deleted 


### 4) Scale the Data

<>
# Chaya: shall we do it?

### 5) Dimentionality Reduction

- Step 1: analysing correlations and identifying variables which are linear combinations of one another

```{r setupfactor, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
# Please ENTER then original raw attributes to use. 
# Please use numbers, not column names, e.g. c(1:5, 7, 8) uses columns 1,2,3,4,5,7,8
factor_attributes_used = c(3:23)

# Please ENTER the selection criterions for the factors to use. 
# Choices: "eigenvalue", "variance", "manual"
factor_selectionciterion = "eigenvalue"

# Please ENTER the desired minumum variance explained 
# (Only used in case "variance" is the factor selection criterion used). 
minimum_variance_explained = 65  # between 1 and 100

# Please ENTER the number of factors to use 
# (Only used in case "manual" is the factor selection criterion used).
manual_numb_factors_used = 15

# Please ENTER the rotation eventually used (e.g. "none", "varimax", "quatimax", "promax", "oblimin", "simplimax", and "cluster" - see help(principal)). Default is "varimax"
rotation_used = "varimax"

```

```{r setupfactor2, echo=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}

factor_attributes_used <- intersect(factor_attributes_used, 1:ncol(ProjectData))
ProjectDataFactor <- ProjectData[,factor_attributes_used]
ProjectDataFactor <- ProjectData <- data.matrix(ProjectDataFactor)

```

## Check Correlations

Analysing correlations and identifying variables which are linear combinations of one another. This is the correlation matrix of all the different attributes/variables for the unique customers we have. 


```{r}
thecor = round(cor(ProjectDataFactor),2)
iprint.df(round(thecor,2), scale=TRUE)
```

## Choose number of factors

Clearly the different column variables have several correlations between them, so we may be able to actually "group" these variables into only a few "key factors". This not only will simplify the data, but will also greatly facilitate our understanding of the lenders club members.

```{r}
# Here is how the `principal` function is used 
UnRotated_Results<-principal(thecor, nfactors=ncol(thecor), rotate="none",score=TRUE)

UnRotated_Factors<-round(UnRotated_Results$loadings,2)
UnRotated_Factors<-as.data.frame(unclass(UnRotated_Factors))
colnames(UnRotated_Factors)<-paste("Comp",1:ncol(UnRotated_Factors),sep="")
iprint.df(round(UnRotated_Factors, 2))
```

```{r}
# Here is how we use the `PCA` function 
Variance_Explained_Table_results<-PCA(ProjectDataFactor, graph=FALSE)
Variance_Explained_Table<-Variance_Explained_Table_results$eig
Variance_Explained_Table_copy<-Variance_Explained_Table

rownames(Variance_Explained_Table) <- paste("Component", 1:nrow(Variance_Explained_Table), sep=" ")
colnames(Variance_Explained_Table) <- c("Eigenvalue", "Pct of explained variance", "Cumulative pct of explained variance")
```

Let's look at the **variance explained** as well as the **eigenvalues**

```{r}
iprint.df(round(Variance_Explained_Table, 2))
```

```{r}
eigenvalues  <- Variance_Explained_Table[, "Eigenvalue"]
df           <- cbind(as.data.frame(eigenvalues), c(1:length(eigenvalues)), rep(1, length(eigenvalues)))
colnames(df) <- c("eigenvalues", "components", "abline")
iplot.df(melt(df, id="components"))
```

## Interpret the factors

This is how the "top factors" look like. 

```{r}
if (factor_selectionciterion == "eigenvalue")
  factors_selected <- sum(Variance_Explained_Table_copy[,1] >= 1)
if (factor_selectionciterion == "variance")
  factors_selected <- 1:head(which(Variance_Explained_Table_copy[,"cumulative percentage of variance"]>= minimum_variance_explained),1)
if (factor_selectionciterion == "manual")
  factors_selected <- manual_numb_factors_used
```
To better visualize them, we will use what is called a "rotation". There are many rotations methods. In this case we selected the `r rotation_used` rotation. For our data, the `r factors_selected` selected factors look as follows after this rotation: 

```{r}
Rotated_Results<-principal(thecor, nfactors=max(factors_selected), rotate=rotation_used,score=TRUE)
Rotated_Factors<-round(Rotated_Results$loadings,2)
Rotated_Factors<-as.data.frame(unclass(Rotated_Factors))
colnames(Rotated_Factors)<-paste("Comp.",1:ncol(Rotated_Factors),sep="")

sorted_rows <- sort(Rotated_Factors[,1], decreasing = TRUE, index.return = TRUE)$ix
Rotated_Factors <- Rotated_Factors[sorted_rows,]

iprint.df(Rotated_Factors, scale=TRUE)
```

To better visualize and interpret the factors we often "suppress" loadings with small values, e.g. with absolute values smaller than 0.5. In this case our factors look as follows after suppressing the small numbers:

```{r}
Rotated_Factors_thres <- Rotated_Factors
Rotated_Factors_thres[abs(Rotated_Factors_thres) < MIN_VALUE]<-NA
colnames(Rotated_Factors_thres)<- colnames(Rotated_Factors)
rownames(Rotated_Factors_thres)<- rownames(Rotated_Factors)

iprint.df(Rotated_Factors_thres, scale=TRUE)
```

The first `r factors_selected` factors that we have selected can be named and interpreted as follows:  
-  Factor 1: Lending Club's rating - how Lending Club has rated the operation  
-  Factor 2: size of operation - the relative size of the operation as measured by the loan installment and its loan amount  
-  Factor 3: sustainability and effort level - level of indebtedness of a given client and his ability to cover debt obligations with his income  
-  Factor 4: employment stability - client's employment lenght in years  
-  Factor 5: mortgage - whether a client is a mortgager, a renter or a home owner (high score indicates that the client has a mortgage, whereas a low score indicates that the client is a home-owner. A neutral score indicates that the client is a renter.)  
-  Factor 6: location - client's current residency address  
-  Factor 7: restructuring - indicates whether the operation is debt-related or unrelated  
-  Factor 8: age - date when the operation was issued  


# Part 2: Customer Segmentation 
### 6) Clustering

```{r setupcluster, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
# We ENTER then original raw attributes that correspond to eigenvalues, to use for the segmentation (the "segmentation attributes")
segmentation_attributes_used = c(8,3,9,20,11,19,17,15 ) #c(6,1,7,18,9,17,15,13 )

# Please ENTER then original raw attributes to use for the profiling of the segments (the "profiling attributes")
# Please use numbers, not column names, e.g. c(1:5, 7, 8) uses columns 1,2,3,4,5,7,8
profile_attributes_used = c(2:21) 

# Please ENTER the number of clusters to eventually use for this report
numb_clusters_used = 5 # for loans use X - depending on findings

# Please enter the method to use for the segmentation:
profile_with = "hclust" #  "hclust" or "kmeans"

# Please ENTER the distance metric eventually used for the clustering in case of hierarchical clustering 
# (e.g. "euclidean", "maximum", "manhattan", "canberra", "binary" or "minkowski" - see help(dist)). 
# DEFAULT is "euclidean"
distance_used = "euclidean"

# Please ENTER the hierarchical clustering method to use (options are:
# "ward", "single", "complete", "average", "mcquitty", "median" or "centroid").
# DEFAULT is "ward"
hclust_method = "ward.D"

# Please ENTER the kmeans clustering method to use (options are:
# "Hartigan-Wong", "Lloyd", "Forgy", "MacQueen").
# DEFAULT is "Lloyd"
kmeans_method = "Lloyd"

```

```{r}
# Same as the initial data
ProjectData <- ProjectData_INITIAL[1:2000,]

#segmentation_attributes_used <- intersect(segmentation_attributes_used, 1:ncol(ProjectData))
profile_attributes_used <- intersect(profile_attributes_used, 1:ncol(ProjectData))

ProjectData_segment <- ProjectData[,segmentation_attributes_used]
ProjectData_profile <- ProjectData[,profile_attributes_used]

ProjectData_scaled <- apply(ProjectData, 2, function(r) if (sd(r)!=0) (r-mean(r))/sd(r) else 0*r)
```

## Steps 1-2: Explore the data
(This was done above, so we skip it)

## Step 3. Select Segmentation Variables

For simplicity will use one representative question for each of the factor we found in Part 1 (we can also use the "factor scores" for each respondent) to represent our survey respondents. These are the `segmentation_attributes_used` selected below. We can choose the question with the highest absolute factor loading for each factor. For example, when we use 5 factors with the varimax rotation we can select questions Q.1.9 (I see my boat as a status symbol), Q1.18 (Boating gives me a feeling of adventure), Q1.4 (I only consider buying a boat from a reputable brand), Q1.11 (I tend to perform minor boat repairs and maintenance on my own) and Q1.2 (When buying a boat  getting the lowest price is more important than the boat brand) - try it. These are columns 10, 19, 5, 12, and 3, respectively of the data matrix `Projectdata`. 
## Step 4: Define similarity measure

We need to define a distance metric that measures how different people (observations in general) are from each other. This can be an important choice. Here are the differences between the observations using the distance metric we selected:

```{r}
euclidean_pairwise <- as.matrix(dist(head(ProjectData_segment, max_data_report), method="euclidean"))
euclidean_pairwise <- euclidean_pairwise*lower.tri(euclidean_pairwise) + euclidean_pairwise*diag(euclidean_pairwise) + 10e10*upper.tri(euclidean_pairwise)
euclidean_pairwise[euclidean_pairwise==10e10] <- NA
rownames(euclidean_pairwise) <- colnames(euclidean_pairwise) <- sprintf("Obs.%02d", 1:max_data_report)

iprint.df(round(euclidean_pairwise))
```

## Step 5: Visualize Pair-wise Distances

We can see the histogram of, say, the first 2 variables (can you change the code chunk in the raw .Rmd file to see other variables?)

```{r}
variables_to_plot = 1:8
do.call(iplot.grid, lapply(variables_to_plot, function(n){
  iplot.hist(ProjectData_segment[, n], breaks=5, xlab = paste("Variable", n))
}))
```

or the histogram of all pairwise distances for the `r distance_used` distance:

```{r}
Pairwise_Distances <- dist(ProjectData_segment, method = distance_used) 
iplot.hist(Pairwise_Distances, breaks=10)
```

## Step 6: Method and Number of Segments

We need to select the clustering method to use, as well as the number of cluster. It may be useful to see the dendrogram from Hierarchical Clustering, to have a quick idea of how the data may be segmented and how many segments there may be. Here is the dendrogram for our data:

```{r}
Hierarchical_Cluster_distances <- Pairwise_Distances #dist(ProjectData_segment, method=distance_used)
Hierarchical_Cluster <- hclust(Hierarchical_Cluster_distances, method=hclust_method)
#Display dendogram
iplot.dendrogram(Hierarchical_Cluster)
# TODO: Draw dendogram with red borders around the 3 clusters
#rect.hclust(Hierarchical_Cluster, k=numb_clusters_used, border="red") 
```

We can also plot the "distances" traveled before we need to merge any of the lower and smaller in size clusters into larger ones - the heights of the tree branches that link the clusters as we traverse the tree from its leaves to its root. If we have n observations, this plot has n-1 numbers, we see the first 20 here. 
```{r}
num <- nrow(ProjectData) - 1
df1 <- cbind(as.data.frame(Hierarchical_Cluster$height[length(Hierarchical_Cluster$height):1]), c(1:num))
colnames(df1) <- c("distances","index")
iplot.df(melt(head(df1, 20), id="index"), xlab="Number of Components")
```

Here is the segment membership of the first `r max_data_report` respondents if we use hierarchical clustering:

```{r}
cluster_memberships_hclust <- as.vector(cutree(Hierarchical_Cluster, k=numb_clusters_used)) # cut tree into 3 clusters
cluster_ids_hclust=unique(cluster_memberships_hclust)

ProjectData_with_hclust_membership <- cbind(1:length(cluster_memberships_hclust),cluster_memberships_hclust)
colnames(ProjectData_with_hclust_membership)<-c("Observation Number","Cluster_Membership")

iprint.df(round(head(ProjectData_with_hclust_membership, max_data_report), 2))
```

while this is the segment membership if we use k-means:

```{r}
kmeans_clusters <- kmeans(ProjectData_segment,centers= numb_clusters_used, iter.max=2000, algorithm=kmeans_method)

ProjectData_with_kmeans_membership <- cbind(1:length(kmeans_clusters$cluster),kmeans_clusters$cluster)
colnames(ProjectData_with_kmeans_membership)<-c("Observation Number","Cluster_Membership")

iprint.df(round(head(ProjectData_with_kmeans_membership, max_data_report), 2))
```


## Step 7: Profile and interpret the segments 

In market segmentation one may use variables to **profile** the segments which are not the same (necessarily) as those used to **segment** the market: the latter may be, for example, attitude/needs related (you define segments based on what the customers "need"), while the former may be any information that allows a company to identify the defined customer segments (e.g. demographics, location, etc). Of course deciding which variables to use for segmentation and which to use for profiling (and then **activation** of the segmentation for business purposes) is largely subjective.  In this case we can use all survey questions for profiling for now - the `profile_attributes_used` variables selected below. 

There are many ways to do the profiling of the segments. For example, here we show how the *average* answers of the respondents *in each segment* compare to the *average answer of all respondents* using the ratio of the two.  The idea is that if in a segment the average response to a question is very different (e.g. away from ratio of 1) than the overall average, then that question may indicate something about the segment relative to the total population. 

Here are for example the profiles of the segments using the clusters found above.  First let's see just the average answer people gave to each question for the different segments as well as the total population:

```{r}
cluster_memberships_kmeans <- kmeans_clusters$cluster 
cluster_ids_kmeans <- unique(cluster_memberships_kmeans)

if (profile_with == "hclust"){
  cluster_memberships <- cluster_memberships_hclust
  cluster_ids <-  cluster_ids_hclust  
}
if (profile_with == "kmeans"){
  cluster_memberships <- cluster_memberships_kmeans
  cluster_ids <-  cluster_ids_kmeans
}

# WE WILL USE THESE IN THE CLASSIFICATION PART LATER
NewData = matrix(cluster_memberships,ncol=1)

population_average = matrix(apply(ProjectData_profile, 2, mean), ncol=1)
colnames(population_average) <- "Population"
Cluster_Profile_mean <- sapply(sort(cluster_ids), function(i) apply(ProjectData_profile[(cluster_memberships==i), ], 2, mean))
if (ncol(ProjectData_profile) <2)
  Cluster_Profile_mean=t(Cluster_Profile_mean)
colnames(Cluster_Profile_mean) <- paste("Seg.", 1:length(cluster_ids), sep="")
cluster.profile <- cbind (population_average,Cluster_Profile_mean)

iprint.df(round(cluster.profile, 2))
```

We can also "visualize" the segments using **snake plots** for each cluster. For example, we can plot the means of the profiling variables for each of our clusters to better visualize differences between segments. For better visualization we plot the standardized profiling variables.

```{r}
ProjectData_scaled_profile = ProjectData_scaled[, profile_attributes_used,drop=F]

Cluster_Profile_standar_mean <- sapply(sort(cluster_ids), function(i) apply(ProjectData_scaled_profile[(cluster_memberships==i), ,drop = F], 2, mean))
if (ncol(ProjectData_scaled_profile) < 2)
  Cluster_Profile_standar_mean = t(Cluster_Profile_standar_mean)
colnames(Cluster_Profile_standar_mean) <- paste("Seg ", 1:length(cluster_ids), sep="")

iplot.df(melt(cbind.data.frame(idx=as.numeric(1:nrow(Cluster_Profile_standar_mean)), Cluster_Profile_standar_mean), id="idx"), xlab="Profiling variables (standardized)",  ylab="Mean of cluster")
```

We can also compare the averages of the profiling variables of each segment relative to the average of the variables across the whole population. This can also help us better understand whether  there are indeed clusters in our data (e.g. if all segments are much like the overall population, there may be no segments). For example, we can measure the ratios of the average for each cluster to the average of the population, minus 1, (e.g. `avg(cluster)` `/` `avg(population)` `-1`) for each segment and variable:

```{r}
population_average_matrix <- population_average[,"Population",drop=F] %*% matrix(rep(1,ncol(Cluster_Profile_mean)),nrow=1)
cluster_profile_ratios <- (ifelse(population_average_matrix==0, 0,Cluster_Profile_mean/population_average_matrix))
colnames(cluster_profile_ratios) <- paste("Seg.", 1:ncol(cluster_profile_ratios), sep="")
rownames(cluster_profile_ratios) <- colnames(ProjectData)[profile_attributes_used]
## printing the result in a clean-slate table
iprint.df(round(cluster_profile_ratios-1, 2))
```

# Part 3: Purchase Drivers
### 8) Build and test the model
- use 80% of the retained data entries to build the model
- use remaining 10% of data entries to test the model. Define the threshold values for test success.

We are interested in understanding the purchase drivers, hence our **dependent** variable is "loan_status" column 17 of the Lending Club Loan data (`r colnames(ProjectData)[17]`). This variable takes value 1 if the loan was fully paid and 0 in the opposite case.

```{r setupclassification, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
# Please ENTER the class (dependent) variable:

# Please enter 1 if you want to randomly split the data in estimation and validation/test. 1 is necessary as the first 2000 rows in cvs file are loanstatus=0
random_sampling = 1

# Tree parameter
# PLEASE ENTER THE Tree (CART) complexity control cp (e.g. 0.001 to 0.02, depending on the data)

# Please enter the minimum size of a segment for the analysis to be done only for that segment
min_segment = 100
```

```{r}
ProjectData = ProjectData_INITIAL[1:5000,] # Just to initialize the data

Probability_Threshold = Probability_Threshold/100 # make it between 0 and 1

dependent_variable = unique(sapply(dependent_variable,function(i) min(ncol(ProjectData), max(i,1))))
independent_variables = unique(sapply(independent_variables,function(i) min(ncol(ProjectData), max(i,1))))

if (length(unique(ProjectData[,dependent_variable])) !=2){
  cat("\n*****\n BE CAREFUL, THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE TAKES MORE THAN 2 VALUES...")
  cat("\nSplitting it around its median...\n*****\n ")
  new_dependent = ProjectData[,dependent_variable] >= median(ProjectData[,dependent_variable])
  ProjectData[,dependent_variable] <- 1*new_dependent
}

Profit_Matrix = matrix(c(actual_1_predict_1, actual_0_predict_1, actual_1_predict_0, actual_0_predict_0), ncol=2)
colnames(Profit_Matrix)<- c("Predict 1", "Predict 0")
rownames(Profit_Matrix) <- c("Actual 1", "Actual 0")
test_data_percent = 100-estimation_data_percent-validation_data_percent
CART_control = rpart.control(cp = CART_cp)
```

This is a "small tree" classification for example:

```{r}
# FIrst we split the data in estimation, validation, and test

if (random_sampling){
  estimation_data_ids=sample.int(nrow(ProjectData),floor(estimation_data_percent*nrow(ProjectData)/100))
  non_estimation_data = setdiff(1:nrow(ProjectData),estimation_data_ids)
  validation_data_ids=non_estimation_data[sample.int(length(non_estimation_data), floor(validation_data_percent/(validation_data_percent+test_data_percent)*length(non_estimation_data)))]
  } else {
    estimation_data_ids=1:floor(estimation_data_percent*nrow(ProjectData)/100)
    non_estimation_data = setdiff(1:nrow(ProjectData),estimation_data_ids)
    validation_data_ids = (tail(estimation_data_ids,1)+1):(tail(estimation_data_ids,1) + floor(validation_data_percent/(validation_data_percent+test_data_percent)*length(non_estimation_data)))
    }

estimation_data=ProjectData[estimation_data_ids,]
validation_data=ProjectData[validation_data_ids,]

After also running the large tree and the logistic regression classifiers, we can then check how much "weight" these three methods put on the different purchase drivers (Q16 of the survey):

```{r}
log_importance = tail(log_coefficients[,"z value", drop=F],-1) # remove the intercept
log_importance = log_importance/max(abs(log_importance))

tree_importance = CART_tree$variable.importance
tree_ordered_drivers = as.numeric(gsub("\\IV"," ",names(CART_tree$variable.importance)))
tree_importance_final = rep(0,length(independent_variables))
tree_importance_final[tree_ordered_drivers] <- tree_importance
tree_importance_final <- tree_importance_final/max(abs(tree_importance_final))
tree_importance_final <- tree_importance_final*sign(log_importance)

large_tree_importance = CART_tree_large$variable.importance
large_tree_ordered_drivers = as.numeric(gsub("\\IV"," ",names(CART_tree_large$variable.importance)))
large_tree_importance_final = rep(0,length(independent_variables))
large_tree_importance_final[large_tree_ordered_drivers] <- large_tree_importance
large_tree_importance_final <- large_tree_importance_final/max(abs(large_tree_importance_final))
large_tree_importance_final <- large_tree_importance_final*sign(log_importance)

Importance_table <- cbind(tree_importance_final,large_tree_importance_final, log_importance)
colnames(Importance_table) <- c("CART 1", "CART 2", "Logistic Regr.")
rownames(Importance_table) <- rownames(log_importance)

iprint.df(Importance_table)
```

Finally, if we were to use the estimated classification models on the test data, we would get the following profit curves (see the raw .Rmd file to select the business profit parameters). 

The profit curve using the small classification tree: 

```{r}
actual_class<- test_data[,dependent_variable]

probs = test_Probability_class1_tree
xaxis = sort(unique(c(0,1,probs)), decreasing = TRUE)
res = Reduce(cbind,lapply(xaxis, function(prob){
  useonly = which(probs >= prob)
  predict_class = 1*(probs >= prob)
  theprofit = Profit_Matrix[1,1]*sum(predict_class==1 & actual_class ==1)+
    Profit_Matrix[1,2]*sum(predict_class==0 & actual_class ==1)+
    Profit_Matrix[2,1]*sum(predict_class==1 & actual_class ==0)+
    Profit_Matrix[2,2]*sum(predict_class==0 & actual_class ==0)
  
  c(100*length(useonly)/length(actual_class), theprofit) 
  }))
xaxis = res[1,]; yaxis = res[2,]
df<-data.frame(Percentile = xaxis, Profit = yaxis)
iplot.df(df, x="Percentile", y="Profit", v=NULL)

best_profits_small_tree = df[which.max(df$Profit),]
```

The profit curve using the large classification tree: 

```{r}
probs = test_Probability_class1_tree_large
xaxis = sort(unique(c(0,1,probs)), decreasing = TRUE)
res = Reduce(cbind,lapply(xaxis, function(prob){
  useonly = which(probs >= prob)
  predict_class = 1*(probs >= prob)
  theprofit = Profit_Matrix[1,1]*sum(predict_class==1 & actual_class ==1)+
    Profit_Matrix[1,2]*sum(predict_class==0 & actual_class ==1)+
    Profit_Matrix[2,1]*sum(predict_class==1 & actual_class ==0)+
    Profit_Matrix[2,2]*sum(predict_class==0 & actual_class ==0)
  
  c(100*length(useonly)/length(actual_class), theprofit) 
  }))
xaxis = res[1,]; yaxis = res[2,]
names(xaxis)<- NULL; names(yaxis) <- NULL
df<-data.frame(Percentile = xaxis, Profit = yaxis)
iplot.df(df, x="Percentile", y="Profit", v=NULL)

best_profits_large_tree = df[which.max(df$Profit),]
```

The profit curve using the logistic regression classifier: 

```{r}
probs = test_Probability_class1_log
xaxis = sort(unique(c(0,1,probs)), decreasing = TRUE)
res = Reduce(cbind,lapply(xaxis, function(prob){
  useonly = which(probs >= prob)
  predict_class = 1*(probs >= prob)
  theprofit = Profit_Matrix[1,1]*sum(predict_class==1 & actual_class ==1)+
    Profit_Matrix[1,2]*sum(predict_class==0 & actual_class ==1)+
    Profit_Matrix[2,1]*sum(predict_class==1 & actual_class ==0)+
    Profit_Matrix[2,2]*sum(predict_class==0 & actual_class ==0)
  
  c(100*length(useonly)/length(actual_class), theprofit) 
  }))
xaxis = res[1,]; yaxis = res[2,]
names(xaxis)<- NULL; names(yaxis) <- NULL
df<-data.frame(Percentile = xaxis, Profit = yaxis)
iplot.df(df, x="Percentile", y="Profit", v=NULL)

best_profits_logistic = df[which.max(df$Profit),]
```

These are the maximum total profit achieved in the test data using the three classifiers (without any segment specific analysis so far).

```{r}
best_profits = rbind(best_profits_small_tree, best_profits_large_tree, best_profits_logistic)
rownames(best_profits) <- c("Small Tree", "Large Tree", "Logistic Regression")
iprint.df(round(best_profits, 2))
```
