## Lending Club Loans

Problem Statement:

The project aims to segment Lending Club's customers based on their likelihood to default.


Process:

1) Define Business Problem
- Produce a precise definition of the target variable: the specific quantity that will be the focus of the data mining

2) Collect Data
- Separate loans finished from loans ongoing

3) Clean Up Data
- Eliminate out of scope data
- Create dummies for non-numeric values

4) Decide on the type of model to use (e.g. classification tree or logistic regression)

5) Choose method to avoid overfitting
